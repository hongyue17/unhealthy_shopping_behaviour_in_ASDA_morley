# Analysing Unhealthy Shopping Patterns at ASDA Morley: Consumer Profiling Based on Basket Types and Geographical Distribution
For my dissertation, I partnered with ASDA to analyse health-conscious shopping behaviours using a dataset of over one million transactions from their Morley store. By applying K-means clustering, I identified a customer segment marked by low spending and minimal item purchases, predominantly focusing on unhealthy products. The study aimed to provide ASDA with deeper insights into customer shopping patterns and to explore the impact of demographic factors, such as the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), Physical Food Environment (PPFI), and education levels. The analysis revealed that customers with lower spending and fewer items in their baskets were more likely to choose unhealthier products, with residents of the LS10 postcode district showing notably less healthy shopping habits compared to other districts in Leeds. These findings have equipped ASDA with valuable insights to guide customers towards healthier purchasing decisions, highlighting my ability to manage large datasets and apply machine learning techniques for strategic analysis.
